[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77) (scoring)

When we run similar experiments to those described in the chapter for looking for bias in using sample statistics for mean and median as an estimator for the mean of a population, we can see that these are do not show bias. As we increase the number of iterations, or number of samples, our estimators each show less error in estimating the true mean of the population.

When we run an experiment for estimating RMSE for estimating values for the biased and unbiased variance, we can see that the RMSE of the biased variance is consistently lower than the unbiased. This difference remains true as we run our experiement over successively larger numbers of iterations, appearing to be roughly 10% smaller.
