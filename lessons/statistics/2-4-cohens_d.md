[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb)

This function gives a result of approximately -0.089. The sign of this value tells us that first babies weigh, on average, less than non-first babies. This difference is small, with later babies being only .08 standard deviations larger than their first counterparts. However, this is a larger difference than length of pregnancy between first born and other children, by a factor of around three.
