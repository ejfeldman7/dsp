[Think Stats Chapter 9 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#toc90) (resampling)

In this exercise, we are comparing two hypothesis tests conducted on the same initial set of data. We are comparing the use of finding p-values by means of permutation with resampling from our data to determine a p-value. 

For birthweights:  
Using the permutation method from earlier in the chapter we found a p-value of 0.0. This is sufficiently small for us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence that a difference exists between the birthweights of first and other children. When we use the resampling method, we find that we also get a p-value of 0.0, so we come to the same conclusion.

For length of pregnancy:  
Using the permutation method from earlier in this chapter, we voudn a p-value of 0.17. We said that this was too large to reject the null and thus concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to say that there exists a difference in the length of pregnancies for first children compared to those born later in order. When we recalculated our test statistic using the resampling method, we got a p-value of 0.1753. This is nearly identical to that which we found earlier, so we would make the same conclusion. 

Overall, in this example, it does not appear as though the choice of methodology, between permutation and resampling, has a significant impact on the hypothesis testing or our conclusions.
